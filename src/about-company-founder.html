        Meet <span class="color-accent-light">Anna Marie</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Looking for the best skin care? I’m Anna Marie and my first job at age
        14 was working on Saturdays in a beauty practice where I learned about
        aesthetics. I didn’t choose it as my career then, but I always
        maintained my love for all things skin care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later I formulated my own personal care products using Australian
        botanicals, long before the term clean beauty was invented or anyone
        knew what it was. Despite my passion for clean beauty, I was dismayed by
        the lack of effectiveness of so many of the products and the high use of
        essential oils and other irritating ingredients.
      </p>
      So many of these products, even cosmeceutical ones, were more likely to
      compromise the skin barrier, cause inflammation and potentially trigger
      discolourations, rather than deliver the skin miracle they were promising.
      <p>
        I kept finding that skin care products containing questionable
        ingredients were being sold to customers without a second thought. Many
        aestheticians and dermatologists were more interested in what would earn
        them the most revenue rather than what would deliver results without
        compromising the long-term health of their clients’ skin. So few of them
        focused on the science behind the ingredients in the formulations or
        independently sought out clinical research, instead relying on the
        marketing information provided by the brands themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        I lost faith in the advice I was being given by well-meaning
        aestheticians and the recommendations of dermatologists, who kept trying
        to sell me inappropriate products and super expensive treatments that
        would have damaged my very sensitive skin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to undertake study in integrative health and dermatology and
        threw myself into endless hours of searching medical and dermatological
        databases and reading published articles. I was struck by the lack of
        real science that sat behind so many skin care products and concerned by
        the number of potentially harmful ingredients.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was determined to improve each of my skin concerns without any
        clinical interventions. I set about finding the best skin care routine
        and products for my skin. I hunted down products from around the world
        and religiously applied them, to find my holy grails. Over the course of
        two years, I tackled my sensitivity, redness, dehydration and
        hyperpigmentation. To my great surprise, I was also able to eliminate
        the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes, even though I
        was not really expecting much. My elevens are less visible and my
        stubborn naso-labial lines look better too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also made a breakthrough with my keratosis pilaris and finally
        achieved smoother skin. I finally stopped getting those welt-like
        breakouts I would get from using those overly heavy urea creams
        recommended by dermatologists. For the first time in my life, the
        ‘chicken skin’ curse was finally behind me.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experiments with hyperpigmentation and finding ingredients that work
        as well as Hydroquinone continue. Trust me when I say I tried dozens of
        products, with ingredients such as AHAs, Arbutin, Kojic Acid,
        Niacinamide, Phenylethyl Resorcinol, Vitamin C, Liquorice Extract,
        Glutathione, Tranexamic Acid and Retinol.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here I am, wanting to share what I’ve learnt along the way so you are
        better informed and can find the real ‘promise keepers’ out there. In
        this way, I hope you’ll get to enjoy the products you use more and not
        needlessly blow money on products that don’t deliver.

      <p>
        Like many of you, I’ve been fascinated by skin health and skin care for
        most of my life and have searched for the best skin care routine and
        products. But finding the truth in the world of skin care proved rather
        elusive.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s difficult to separate marketing claims from clinical research and
        the truth. With all the celebrity endorsements, dermatologist
        influencers and magazine affiliate marketing masquerading as editorial,
        it’s become harder than ever to find reliable information on what
        ingredients are good for the skin and what products actually works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trying to learn the science of it and learn which
        <a href="skin-care-ingredients.html" class="text-link">Skin Care Ingredients</a>
        get results and which ones damage the skin is overwhelming for most
        people, particularly given all the conflicting information out there.
        That’s why Skin Clinica was born.
      </p>
      <p>

        hope you can find the best skin care routine and products for your skin.
